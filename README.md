# [WIP] Habitica Things Sync

This project aims to sync Habitica and Things, picking up from the Ron Lipke's work on [things-bitica](https://github.com/ronlipke/things-bitica). Unlike a simple shell script this will be a NodeJS command-line tool build with packages like `commander` and `better-sqlite3`
